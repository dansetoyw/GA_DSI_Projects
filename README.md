### Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

##### Problem Statement

Should United States' (US) standardised college readiness tests' (i.e. American College Testing, ACT and SAT) results be included as the measures for the ranking of the best States for education?
 
ACT and SAT results are often included in the methodology to rank the States' education system. Some examples of the online publications on ranking of the best States for education are 'Education Rankings - Measuring how well states are educating their students' by USNew ([*source*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education/prek-12)), 'Best States for Education 2022' by World Population Review ([*source*](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/best-states-for-education)) and 'States with Best & Worst Public School' by Scholaroo ([*source*](https://scholaroo.com/report/state-education-rankings/)).

It is important for media to provide accurate reports. Misinformation may lead to losing credibility from viewers as well as effecting wrong decision. 

The inclusion of standardised college readiness tests' results in the ranking methodology is of concern due to low and declining participation percentage of these tests which may affect the report's accuracy. In this study, we explore the participation trend and correlation between the participation percentage and the test's score for ACT and SAT.

### Problem Statement

Real Sky Estate Development has been developing residential areas around Ames and is looking to procure and develop new housing in the area.

Previous housing developments were not returning favourable profits due to the recent pandemic and political tensions. It also caused a rise in the costs of living and building materials over the years.

Facing a forecasted recession in the upcoming year, Real Sky senior management team has reached out to our data science team to pinpoint factors that will direct towards revamping the company's focus structure to improve the attractiveness and sales price of new housing developments.

What core features should we focus on to increase the sale price of homes for our next development project?

### Problem Statement

An influx of inexperienced pets owners overly reliant on vets and pet store reduces work efficiency, how can we optimize it?

Our flagship product (Pet Companions), our highly-rated mobile application offering pet owners information through:
- AI-powered chatbot 
 - First level of customer inquiry
 - Source of information for pet owners
- Recommends articles based on classification of queries
- A knowledge-bank filled with information sourced from vets, pet experts and users

However, our chatbot requires an update to increase its effectiveness in order to meet higher demand.

Using web apis and NLP to create an improved classifier model to better classify posts to cats and dogs and recommend information to pet owners accordingly.
